- I was motivated to get my hands on coding for the first time.

## Usage

This webpage can be used as a refresher to the vital material we learned in the introduction of the bootcamp. For example the use of adding code to the repository using git commands. Here we could revisit commands like "git add -A" to add code or "git pull original main" to make sure main branch is up to date.
